        <p>Please read these instructions carefully.</p>
        <p>
            This is a Figma template provided as a guide for the Assessment Task
            documentation submission. This is an individual submission; each
            group member must produce and submit their own version. Group
            members can share co-produced assets from the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            We suggest that groups work collaboratively on their Figma Group
            Project Template, with each member working on their own individual
            version using this template.
        </p>
        <p>
            This template was created based on our Unit’s visual style. You are
            expected to design your own layouts and visual style to suit your
            proposal. Templates that were shared in class should also be
            re-styled (where possible) to suit your overall design proposal and
            style.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the A4 Frames as a scaling guide, and understand what font sizes
            you should be working at.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pro tip: When scaling down your wireframes, use the Scale tool (‘K’
            shortcut) to reduce your grouped elements uniformly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, right click on a wireframe/element and Copy/Paste As{" "}
            {">"} Copy as PNG – you can then paste and scale the image to your
            liking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: check and adjust font sizes and other properties when scaling
            components in Figma.
